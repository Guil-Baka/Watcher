<h1> What is watcher? </h1>

<p> Watcher is a program I'm writing to integrate facial detection and into every camera capable of RTMP and RTSP</p>

<p> Endgoal of the project is for sysadmin to be able to manually register users, however if user is unknown it will add that user to a temporary subfolder and assing it a numerical ID for verification after detection</p>
<p> Program should keep track of faces in frame and i will try to tune it for side profiles. </p>

<h3> To start just run main.py. Dont forget to instal opencv</h3>
<h4> Just use 'pip install opencv-python'</h4>
